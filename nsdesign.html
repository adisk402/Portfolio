			I won a school wide competion which was created in order to re-design the schools "#WeAreNewschool" tshirt. In order to create this design I had to really think about what made the school stand out.</p>

				<p>One thing that I love most about The New School is that it allows for variety. The university is unique because it is the combination of different distinct schools which all nurture different talents in students. In this design, I attempt to visualize the diversity which makes The New School what it is by bringing a variety of elements together to create a balanced composition.
