		<p class="col-6 content2">During the most recent World Cup tournament, a friend and I began to work on a brand called Nationhood. The brand was created to inspire hope for the future of our country(Nigeria). In order to this I worked on shirt designs and a video which chanelled the energy of the World Cup to something positive.</p>
		<h1>
			P96
		</h1>
		<a><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/231198331?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen class="col-6 content2"></iframe></a><p class="col-6 content2">This video was made in the summer of 2017, for a clothing brand called P96. The brand owner, Peter Johnson, and I discussed beforehand about the aim of the video being to reflect his homecoming. He is a Nigerian designer who has lived a majority, and most recent part of his life in New York.</p><p class="col-6 content2">The video’s aim was to document his contribution to his home(Lagos) as we organized a football tournament. In order to show his appreciation for the people who came out to play, P96 jerseys were donated to the players before the game began. It was an event which was set up relatively quick and aimed specifically at the locals. There were challenges faced in getting the game started but it eventually ended as a success.</p>
