		<h2>
			Branding Statement
		</h2>

		<div>
		<p class="col-6 content2">
			Airbnb is a housing service that accommodates millions of people, yet does not own one apartment. It is a business which provides a second option for travelers who don’t want to live in costly hotels but still want to feel comfortable. By creating this service, they have acquired an audience base which spans across various age groups and socio economic backgrounds. However, this service could still be costly for college students. </p>

<p class="col-6 content2">Couch Crash recognizes this audience and is tailored towards serving them best. Couch Crash is a housing service which provides rooms for people to live in in a common space with others. Rather than having rent a whole apartment/ house Couch Crash provides the option for rented spaces to be shared by different users. The target audience for this service are young adults ranging from the ages 18-25, looking for an inexpensive place to rent for a short period and making new friends at the same time. The brand is firstly going to be approachable, which would influence the service to not just be convenient but memorable(in a positive way). Couch Crash is going to be a reliable friend to the users, guiding them throughout their experience, and still making them feel in control. The brand would provide a chill user experience, but at the same time be clear with its messages. Couch Crash’s  major competition is Airbnb and its objective is to attract the percentage of its audience under the age of 25.

		<h2>
			Design Guideline
		</h2>

		<p class="col-6 content2">
			The design guideline for this service is created to appeal to the targeted audience, being college students. In order to do this, a few rules have been created to creat chances for experimentation. The first rule is typographic and is that the name ‘Couch crash’ should always be written in helvetica Neue and capitalized. The second rule is that whenever typography is used, in some way, bright colors should be involved. Prefered colors are red, blue and yellow. Lastly, the use of illustrations should be more to the unrealistic looking and funny look (if possible). A system has been created in which a variety of conjoined individuals are illustrated to reflect the brands logo. “bringing friends together”.

		<h2>
			App Inspo
		</h2>

	<p class="col-6 content2">
		Spotify is a music streaming service. Amongst the many other music streaming services, one thing spotify has over the competition is its personal look. 
The interface has been purposefully designed this way and this is a quality couch crash should have as well.

<img src="img/couch/5.jpg" class="col-6 content2">

<p class="col-6 content2">
	The illustration style, as mentioned before, should be simple and closer to the unrealistic look. The example in the middle best examplifies the direction couch crash should move towards with illustrations. The look is simple and cheeky.

	<h2>
		App Example
	</h2>

	<img src="img/couch/store.png" class="col-6 content2">

	<p class="col-6 content2"> 
		The app as mentioned before should feel personal. And in order to do this a coloboration with the platform ‘bitmoji’ should be made to add the a customizable feature to the app. A major part of the brand is the idea of the couch. In order to promote this the landing page of the app would be the user’s bitmoji sitting on a couch.  
	</p>

	<img src="img/couch/couch.gif" class="col-6 content2">

	<p class="col-6 content2">
		Another major branding feature is the conjoined people illustration. In order to introduce people to this, before the home page loads, a display of the different illustrations would appear as the page loads.
