			I directed this short film for a final project which was really exciting to work on. The idea behind it is placing the nuclear war scares of the cold war and terrorist attacks of today next to each other. I attempted to tell a short story about how we live in a world of fear and how we never know what is safe. In terms of production, there was a lot that could have been done better, but due to the lack of time aspects such as audio were lacking.
