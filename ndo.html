		<p class="col-6 content2">
			This is the rough draft of a documentary project that was canceled. The video documents a day in the life of a Liberian fitness enthusiast, Robbert Wilmote. He was featured in a short film about his life and the day this documentary was recorded was the premier.
		</p>

		<p class="col-6 content2">
			The documentary attempts to show the different sides of Robbertâ€™s personality. We see him as a health awear trainer, as a son, father, brother and husband throughout the documentary. Although this documentary was never finished, it is a project I learnt a lot from and am glad to have experienced.
