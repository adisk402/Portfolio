			This is the first film I made and it is a scilent film about a character called Dave.

		<h2>The story of Dave</h2>
		<p class="col-6 content2">
			It was a starkly cold night and detective dave knew it in his guts that their was something rotten in the state of New York(zoom into face)(Dn Dn Dn!!!). The week had been a quiet one and the detective hadn't had much work on his table(picture of table filled with homework). Right now he was craving some action and his recently rehabilitated cocaine snorting nose could smell the thrilling aroma of danger.(zoom into nose)(Dn Dn Dn!!!)</p>
<p class="col-6 content2">His partner Detective Dom was off duty, but Dave took no days off. he walks around the room his hands itching for motion, and heart boiling adrenaline. </p>
<p class="col-6 content2">He hears a noise!(zoom into face) But it was just the recoiling of his cheap window blinds.(picture of window blinds). </p>
<p class="col-6 content2">The high pitch noise of silence was aching his ears so he put on his headphones and turned up to some tailor swift just so he could distract hisself.</p>
<p class="col-6 content2">Hours went by and Dave eventually passed out. His rest was peaceful but the call for adventure rose him from his slumber.</p> 
<p class="col-6 content2">He decided to take a snack from the kitchen to fuel his razor sharp senses; but something caught his attention. What was it? It moved once, then twice. Before the detective could think, this thing! began to chase him!
